		<p>
			To enable ${pom.name} developers to work together, we
			keep the source code in revision control systems called
			Subversion. Developers have write access to the Subversion
			repository, enabling them to make changes to the source
			code. Everyone has read access to the repositories, so you
			may download the most up-to-date development version of the
			software. Note that the latest version in the Subversion
			repository many not work as expected, it may not even
			compile properly. If you are looking for a stable release of
			the source code, you should download an official
			distribution instead of the latest version in the Subversion
			repositories.

			There are several ways to access the Subversion
			repositories:

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Web Access</h2>
		</div>
		<p>
			If you just wish to browse around or download a few
			individual files, the best tool is the web-based ViewCVS
			interface for CVS repositories and ViewCVS interface for
			Subversion or go straight to the public repositories at:
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="${pom.scm.url}">
				${pom.name} SVN Repository
			</a>
		</p>

			<h2>Checking out a read-only copy</h2>
		</div>
		<p>
			To access the Subversion repositories anonymously, you will
			need a Subversion client.

			To check out the ${pom.name}, issue the following command:
		</p>

		<div class="source">svn co ${pom.scm.connection}</div>
