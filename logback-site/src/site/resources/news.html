			<h2>Logback News</h2>

		<p>Here are the latest news about logback.</p>

    <h3>January 31st, 2007 - Release of version 0.9</h3>

    <p>
      This version contains a new component, namely the <code>ContextSelector</code>,
      that provides context separation and management when logback is used
      by several web-apps running under the same server. A 
      <a href="manual/contextSelector.html">new chapter</a> was added to the logback manual to detail 
      the use of the <code>ContextSelector</code>, along with its associated components.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The <code>JMXConfigurator</code> has been improved. It now shows the context's
      Status objects, which lets users check the internal state of logback.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The logback manual's chapter 2, about <a href="manual/architecture.html">logback's architecture</a>, 
      has been updated with two sections: Under the hood and Performance.
    </p>
    
    <h3>January 23th, 2007 - Release of version 0.8.1</h3>

    <p>
      This version contains new components in the Access module, allowing users
      to display the full HttpServletRequest or HttpServletResponse of an access event.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The documentation section has been updated. The short introduction was split
      into the chapter 1 and chapter 2 of the logback manual. The chapters about
      Appenders and Layouts have been updated to document new components of logback.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A demonstration webApp presenting logback's major components is available.
      A document explains how to run it, and provides a step-by-step visit of the
      demo.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A first translation of logback jars to JDK1.4 is present in this release.

			of the site. We'd like to thank Sebastian Davids for his ideas and contributions to this
			component.
