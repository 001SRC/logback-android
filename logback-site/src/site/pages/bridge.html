    <h2>Log4j bridge</h2>
    
    <p>As of version 0.7, logback ships with a new module called
    <em>log4j-bridge</em>.  It allows log4j users to use logback
    without changing a single line of code in their application. All
    that is needed to do is to replace the log4j.jar file with the
    appropriate logback jars.
    </p>
    
    <h3>How does it work?</h3>

    <p>The log4j-bridge module contains replacements of most widely
    used log4j classes, namely <code>Category</code>,
    <code>Level</code>, <code>Logger</code>, <code>MDC</code>,
    <code>Priority</code>, <code>BasicConfigurator</code>
    and <code>Log4jLoggerFactory</code>.  These
    replacement classes redirect loggging calls to the corresponding
    logback methods.
    </p>

    <p>
			To use log4j-bridge in your own application, the first step is
			to locate and remove the <em>log4j.jar</em> file and replace it
			with <em>log4j-bridge.jar</em> which ships with logback. Note
			that you still need logback-classic and its dependencies for the
			log4j-bridge to work properly. In summary, here is a list of the
			required jars:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				log4j-bridge-<em>VERSION</em>.jar
			</li>
			<li>
				logback-classic-<em>VERSION</em>.jar
			</li>
			<li>
				logback-core-<em>VERSION</em>.jar
			</li>
			<li>
				slf4j-api-<em>VERSION</em>.jar
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
			This is what it takes to make logback your logging implementation when using log4j.
			It will use logback's automatic basic configuration, displaying the logging requests
			in the console. More advanced use will require a configuration file and other jars
			which are logback dependencies. A file called <em>logback.xml</em>, 
			placed in the application's classpath, will be automatically loaded by logback.
		</p>

    <h3>When does it not work?</h3>
    
    <p>
    	The <em>log4-bridge</em> module does not work when the application calls
    	log4j components that are not present in the bridge.
    	For examples, direct creation of log4j <code>Appenders</code> or 
    	<code>Filters</code> will not work.
    </p>
		
		<p>
			However, in most situations, log4j finds its configuration file and 
			configures itself. In these cases, the application will only issue calls
			to the classes that are contained in the <em>log4j-bridge</em>.
