    <h2>Logback License</h2>
  </div>
  
  <p>Logback source code and binaries are distributed under the <a
  href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">GNU Lesser General
  Public License</a> as published by the Free Software Foundation.

Copyright (C) 2000-2006, QOS.ch

<!-- =========================================== -->

<p>Logback will remain an open-source project distributed under the
LGPL for the foreseeable future -- foreseeable as in the future you
can reasonably think or talk about. In other words, there are no plans
whatsoever to make logback a commercial project.
</p>

<p>Please note that logback is intended to be used behind the SLF4J
API, which is licensed under <a
href="http://www.slf4j.org/license.html">an X11 type license</a>.
</p>

<p>If you wish to make a significant contribution to the logback
project, we invite you to file <a href="cla.txt">Contributor License
Agreement</a>. The purpose of this agreement is to formalize the terms
of your contribution and to protect the project in case of litigation.
</p>


<h3>Classpath Exception</h3>

<p>According to the terms of LGPL, a "Combined Work" is a work
produced by combining or linking an Application with logback (the
Library). In section 4, the LGPL mandates that one may convey a
Combined Work under terms of one's choice that, taken together,
effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the
Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for
debugging such modifications.
</p>

<p>As a special exception, the copyright holders of logback give you
permission to link logback with independent modules to produce an
executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
module. An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
based on logback. If you modify logback, you may extend this exception
to your version of logback, but you are not obliged to do so. If you
do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your
version.
