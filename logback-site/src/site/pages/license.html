<p>As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give
you permission to link this library with independent modules to

for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the
license of that module. An independent module is a module which is not
derived from or based on this library. If you modify this library, you
may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are
not obliged to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this
