    <h3>MMMM Dth, 2007 - Release of version 0.9.Y</h3>
    
    <p>Includes in configuration files are now supported by Joran,
     logback's configuration framework. A file can contain an
     <em>include</em> element that has a <em>file</em> or <em>url</em>
     attribute pointing to a configuration file.  See the <a
     href="manual/joran.html#Include">chapter about configuration</a>
     in the logback's online manual for more information.
    </p>
    
    <p>
     Corrected bug 53 reported by Wilkins Poe. There is now a 
     <a href="dependencies.html">dependencies
     page</a> that shows the requirements of each of logback's modules.
    </p>
    

    <h3>March 5th, 2007 - Release of version 0.9.2</h3>

		<h3>March 5th, 2007 - Release of version 0.9.1</h3>

		zone.</p>
		
    <p><a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=45">Bug

    log4j-bridge module. </p>

		<h3>January 31st, 2007 - Release of version 0.9</h3>

    <p>
      This version contains a new component, namely the

      and management when logback is used by several web-apps running
      under the same server. A <a
      href="manual/contextSelector.html">new chapter</a> was added to
      the logback manual to detail the use of the
      <code>ContextSelector</code>, along with its associated
      components.
    </p>
    
    <p>

      the context's Status objects, which lets users check the
      internal state of logback.

      href="manual/architecture.html">logback's architecture</a>, has
