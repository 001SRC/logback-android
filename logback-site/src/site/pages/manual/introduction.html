    <h2>What is logback?</h2>

    <p>
    	Logback is intended as a successor to the popular log4j project.
    	It was designed by Ceki G&#252;lc&#252;, log4j's founder.  It
    	builds upon a decade long experience gained in designing
    	industrial-strength logging systems. The resulting product,
    	logback is faster with a smaller footprint than all existing
    	logging systems, sometimes by a wide margin. Logback also offers
    	unique and rather useful features such as Markers, parameterized
    	logging statements, conditional stack tracing and powerful event
    	filtering. These are only few examples of useful features
    	logback has to offer. For its own error reporting, logback
    	relies on <code>Status</code> objects, which greatly facilitate
    	troubleshooting. You may wish to rely on Status objects in
    	contexts other than logging. Logback-core bundles Joran, a
    	powerful and generic configuration system, which can be put to
    	use in your own projects to great effect.
    </p>

    <h2>First Baby Step</h2>

    <div class="highlight">
    <p>
      In order to run the examples in this introduction, you need
      to make sure that certain jar files are present on the
      classpath.
      Please refer to the <a href="../setup.html">setup page</a>
      for further details.
    </p>

    <a name="Requirements"></a>
    <h3>Requirements</h3>

    <p>Logback-classic module requires the presence
    <em>slf4j-api.jar</em>, <em>logback-core.jar</em> in addition to
    <em>logback-classic.jar</em> on the classpath.
    </p>


    <p>Let us now begin experimenting with logback.</p>

<em>Example 1.1: Basic template for logging (<a href="../xref/chapter1/HelloWorld1.html">logback-examples/src/main/java/chapter1/HelloWorld1.java</a>)</em>
<div class="source"><pre>package chapter1;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class HelloWorld1 {

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger("chapter1.HelloWorld1");
    logger.debug("Hello world.");

  }
}</pre></div>

    <p>
      The <code>HelloWorld</code> class is defined in the
      <code>chapter1</code> package. It starts by importing the <code>Logger</code>
      and <code>LoggerFactory</code>
      classes defined in the SLF4J API, more specifically within the <code>org.slf4j</code>
      package.
    </p>


    <p>
      On the first line of the main() method, the variable named <code>logger</code>
      is assigned a <code>Logger</code>
      instance retreived by invoking the static method <code>getLogger</code>
      in the <code>LoggerFactory</code> class. 
      This logger is named "chapter1.HelloWorld1". The main method proceeds to call the
      <code>debug</code> method of this logger passing "Hello World" as an argument. 
      We say that the main
      method contains a logging statement of level debug with the message "Hello world".
    </p>

    <p>
      You will note that the above example does not reference any
      logback classes. In most cases, as far as logging is
      concerned, your classes will need to import only SLF4J
      classes. In principle, you will have to import logback
      classes only for configuring logback. Thus, the vast
      majority of your classes will only be cognizant of SLF4J API
      and oblivious to the existence of logback.
    </p>


    <p>You can launch the first
    sample application, <em>chapter1.HelloWord1</em> with the command:
    </p>
    <div class="source"><pre>java chapter1.HelloWorld1</pre></div>

    <p>
      Launching the <code>HelloWorld1</code>
      application will output a single line on the console. By virtue of
      to logback's default configuration policy, when no default file 
      is found to configure logback explicitely, logback will add a 
      <code>ConsoleAppender</code> to the root logger.
    </p>

<div class="source"><pre>20:49:07.962 [main] DEBUG chapter1.HelloWorld1 - Hello world.</pre></div>

    <p>
      Logback can report information about its internal state
      using a built-in status system. Important events occuring
      during logback's lifetime can be accessed through a
      <code>StatusManager</code>. For the time being, let us instruct logback to print its
      internal state. This is accomplished by a static method in
      the <code>LoggerStatusPrinter</code>
      class.
    </p>

<em>Example 1.2: Printing Logger Status (<a href="../xref/chapter1/HelloWorld2.html">logback-examples/src/main/java/chapter1/HelloWorld2.java</a>)</em>
<div class="source"><pre>package chapter1;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
<b>import ch.qos.logback.classic.util.LoggerStatusPrinter;</b>

public class HelloWorld2 {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger("chapter1.HelloWorld2");
    logger.debug("Hello world.");
    <b>LoggerStatusPrinter.printStatusInDefaultContext();</b>
  }
}</pre></div>


   <p>Running the <code>HelloWorld2</code> application will produce
   the following output:</p>

<div class="source"><pre>20:49:07.962 [main] DEBUG chapter1.HelloWorld2 - Hello world.
|-INFO in ch.qos.logback.classic.BasicConfigurator@1c1ea29 - Setting up default configuration.</pre></div>


  <p>
    Logback explains that it configured itself using its default
    policy, which is a basic <code>ConsoleAppender</code>. 
    An <code>Appender</code> is a class that can be
    seen as an output destination. Appenders exist for many different
    destinations including the console, files, Syslog, TCP Socket, JMS and
    many more. Users can also easily create their own Appenders as
    appropriate for their specific situation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The previous examples are rather simple. However, actual logging
    in a larger application would not be any different. The general
    pattern logging statements will not change. Only the configuration
    process will be different since you will certainly need a more
    specific configuration than what logback provides by default. 
    As you will see later on in this document,
    configuring logback can be done in different flexible and
    powerfull ways. Note that, normally, you won't need to invoke
    <code>LoggerStatusPrinter</code>
    after your log statements.
  </p>

  <p> 
    Here is a list of the three required steps in order to enable
    logging in your application.
  </p>

  <ol>

    <p>Configure the logback environment. You can do so in several
    more or less sophisticated ways. More on this later.</p>

    <p>In every class where you wish to perform logging, retrieve a
    <code>Logger</code> instance by invoking the
    <code>org.slf4j.LoggerFactory</code> class'
    <code>getLogger()</code> method, passing the current class name
    or the class itself as parameter.</p>
    
    <p>Use this logger instance by invoking its printing methods,
    namely the debug(), info(), warn() and error(). This will
    produce logging output on the configured appenders.</p>
  </ol>

  <h2>Building logback</h2>  
  
  <!-- 
  
   Try downloading the file manually from:
      http://java.sun.com/products/jms/docs.html

  Then, install it using the command:
      mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=javax.jms -DartifactId=jms \
          -Dversion=1.1 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=/path/to/file 
  
   -->
  
  
  <p>Logback relies on <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven2</a> as
  its build tool. Maven2 is a widely-used open-source build tool. 
  </p>

  <p>Once you have installed Maven2, building the logback project,
  including all its modules, should be as easy as issuing a <code>mvn
  package</code> command in a terminal or command window from within
  the directory where you unarchived the logback distribution
  file. Maven will automatically download the required external
  libraries and use them. However, certain artefacts cannot be
  downloaded from the Maven2 repository. At present, time only the JMS
  API from from SUN Inc. needs to be downloaded and installed
  separately into your local repository.
  </p>

  <p>You can manually download the <a
  href="http://java.sun.com/products/jms/docs.html">JMS API from
  Sun</a>. Once you have downloaded the <em>jms.jar</em> file, you can
  install it in your local Maven 2 repository by issuing the command:
  </p>

  <p class="source">mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=javax.jms -DartifactId=jms -Dversion=1.1 /
     -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=/path/to/jms.jar.file
  </p>

  <p>Logback distributions contain complete source code such that you
  can modify parts of logback library and build your own version of
  it. You may even redistribute the modified version, as long as you
  adhere to the conditions of the LGPL License.
