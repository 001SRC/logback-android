  <h2>Professional support</h2>

  <p>Although the quality of support in the various public logback
  mailing lists is very good, these are operated on a best-effort
  basis. If you require guaranteed response times and in-depth advice
  from developers intimately acquainted with logback, then do consider
  our professional support package.
  </p>

  <p>As the founders and current maintainers of the logback project,
  we can offer you highest quality of support. Opting for our
  professional logback support service is a great way to leverage the
  expertise of developers who have in depth knowledge of the logback
  framework.
