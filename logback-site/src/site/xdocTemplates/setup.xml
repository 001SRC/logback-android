<h2>Classpath Setup</h2>

<p>
Setting up an environment to run the logback examples mainly consists 
of putting a few jars in your classpath. For most examples, these are:
</p>

<ul>
	<p>logback-core-${version}.jar</p>
	<p>logback-classic-${version}.jar</p>
	<p>logback-examples-${version}.jar</p>
	<p>slf4j-api-${slf4j.version}.jar</p>
</ul>

<p>
Assuming your current directory is
<em>$LOGBACK_HOME/logback-examples</em>, where <em>$LOGBACK_HOME</em> is the
directory you've installed logback, you can launch the first
sample application,
<em>chapter1.HelloWord1</em>
with the command:
</p>

<div class="source"><pre>java -cp
 lib/slf4j-api-${slf4j.version}.jar;../logback-core-${version}.jar;\
 ../logback-classic-${version}.jar;logback-examples-${version}.jar\
 chapter1.HelloWorld1</pre></div>

<p>
Having to include the jars in each command you run is not practical, 
to say the least. Two scripts are available to help you setup the jars
in your system's classpath. They are located in 
<em>$LOGBACK_HOME/logback-examples</em>.
</p>

<p>
To run these scripts, you need to edit them and set the variable called
<em>LB_HOME</em> to the directory where you've installed logback.
</p>

<p>
Unless specified differently, running the examples by using the command
provided in the manual will work if it is run from the 
<em>$LOGBACK_HOME/logback-examples</em> directory.
