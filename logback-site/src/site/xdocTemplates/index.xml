		<h2>Logback Project</h2>
		<p>
			Logback is intended as a successor to the popular log4j
			project. It was also designed by Ceki G&#252;lcü, the
			founder of the log4j project. It builds upon exerience gained in
			building industrial-strength logging systems going back as far
			as 1999.
		</p>
		<p>
			Logback's basic architecture is sufficiently generic so as
			to apply under different circumstances. At present time,
			logback is divided into three modules, Core, Classic and
			Access.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Core module lays the groundwork for the other two
			modules. The Classic module can be assimilated to an
			improved version of log4j. Logback Classic natively
			implements the
			<a href="http://www.slf4j.org">SLF4J API</a>
			so that you can readily switch back and forth between
			logback and other logging systems such as log4j or JDK14
			Logging.

			The Access module integrates with Servlet containers to
			provide HTTP-access log functionality. Note that you can
			easily build your own modules on top of the Core module.
