		<h2>Logback Project</h2>
		<p>
			Logback is intended as a successor to the popular log4j
			project. It was designed by Ceki G&#252;lc&#252;, the founder of the
			log4j project. It builds upon exerience gained in building
			industrial-strength logging systems going back as far as 1999.
		</p>
		<p>
			Logback's basic architecture is sufficiently generic so as to
			apply under different circumstances. At present time, logback is
			divided into three modules, logback-core, logback-classic and
			logback-access.
		</p>

		<p>
			The logback-core module lays the groundwork for the other two
			modules. The logback-classic module can be assimilated to a
			significantly improved version of log4j. Moreover,
			logback-classic natively implements the <a
			href="http://www.slf4j.org">SLF4J API</a> so that you can
			readily switch back and forth between logback and other logging
			systems such as log4j or JDK14 Logging.

			The Access module integrates with Servlet containers to
			provide HTTP-access log functionality. Note that you can
			easily build your own modules on top of the Core module.
