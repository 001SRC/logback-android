		<h2>Logback Team</h2>

		<p>Let us introduce you to the logback team members:</p>
		
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="images/jeannoel.gif" alt="Jean-Noel"/></td>
				<td>
					Jean-Noel Charpin has been designing and developing object oriented software 
					and decision making systems since 1998. He is particularly interested in 
					translating lean manufacturing principles and practices to the software development
					domain in order to improve quality and reliability.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="images/ceki.gif" alt="Ceki"/></td>
				<td>
					Ceki G&#252;lc&#252; has been working on logging systems since 1996. 
					He is the founder of the log4j as well as logback projects. 
					Ceki very much enjoys writing software, a task far more difficult 
					than what it might seem at first sight. 
					One of the core lessons he has learned is that unit tests lie
					at the heart of maintainable software.

				<td>
					S&#233;bastien Pennec has been using computers for the most part of
					his life, be it as a hobby, or during his studies or, 
					more recently, as Software Engineer. He loves to write software in dynamic
					and enthusiastic environments, while learning new technologies and practices.
